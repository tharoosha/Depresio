The system includes various modules such as emotion recognition and analysis, personalized therapy recommendations, chatbot-based counseling, virtual reality therapy, mental health prediction, virtual peer support groups, personalized mood tracking, cognitive-behavioral therapy, stress management, and mental health chatbot for employees.

The codebase is written in Python and uses popular ML and NLP libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, NLTK, and SpaCy. The repository also includes pre-trained models, datasets, and scripts for training and testing the models.

The documentation includes detailed instructions on how to set up and run the system, as well as explanations of the underlying algorithms and methodologies used in the AI models. Additionally, the repository includes a list of potential future improvements and directions for research.

Contributions to this project are welcome, and we encourage collaboration from researchers, developers, and mental health professionals to continue advancing the field of virtual mental consulting using AI.
